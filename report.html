        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> 
        Game Critics Gathered comes from my love of games and despise of how the gaming industry is run. I have always been a gamer and by that logic, I have always been a game critic. I am also 
        a game designer professionally. I had a chance to witness the industry from both sides and one thing that has always bothered me, is how much non-disclosed advertisement there is in the
        gaming industry. I have always been a fan of the idea of democratizing game criticism. I believe that the best way to do that is to create a platform where anyone can post their reviews
        and opinions about games. As I said in the F.A.Q, The most important goal of a game critic is to inform the purchase of the audience. I wanted to design a website that would allow anyone
        to post their reviews and opinions about games and allow the audience to make their own decisions. <br>
        <br>
        By this logic, I have designed a flow for a game critic that will allow them to post their honest reviews and opinions about games. I have also designed a flow for the audience that will
        allow them to read the reviews and opinions of other game critics and make their own decisions. I wanted to create the website in such a way that no criticism is buried under the other
        and that the audience can easily find the reviews and opinions that they are looking for. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This is the reason of big emphasis on the search engine, dropdown menus and the search page. As another way to democritize game criticism, I have also designed a submission page that will
        allow anyone to submit their reviews and opinions about games. I also wanted to have a very simple and clean design for the website. This is another reason of my emphasis on accessibility.
